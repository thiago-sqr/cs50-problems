# CS50-problems
Solving the problem sets proposed by Harvard University's CS50x course (2023): Introduction to Computer Science.

## Repository Structure

### pset1: C
- [hello.c](/pset1/hello/hello.c) : Program that prints "hello" and your name.
- [mario.c](/pset1/mario) : Implementations (less and more complex) of the Mario pyramid.
- [cash.c](/pset1/cash/cash.c) : Program that calculates the number of coins for change.
- [credit.c](/pset1/credit/credit.c) : Program that identifies the credit card issuer.

### pset2: Arrays
- [readability.c](/pset2/readability/readability.c) : Implementation of the Coleman-Liau index to gauge the understandability of a text.
- [bulbs.c](/pset2/bulbs/bulbs.c) : Encoding messages in binary using sequences of bulbs.
- [caesar.c](/pset2/caesar/caesar.c) : Implementation of the Caesar cipher algorithm.
- [substitution.c](/pset2/substitution/substitution.c) : Implementation of the substitution cipher.
- [wordle.c](/pset2/wordle/wordle.c) : Word-guessing game, similar to the famous [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).
