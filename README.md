Solving the problem sets proposed by Harvard University's CS50x course (2024): Introduction to Computer Science.

## Repository Structure

### pset1: C
- [hello.c](/pset1/hello/hello.c) : Program that prints "hello" and your name.
- [mario.c](/pset1/mario) : Implementations (less and more complex) of the Mario pyramid.
- [cash.c](/pset1/cash/cash.c) : Program that calculates the number of coins for change.
- [credit.c](/pset1/credit/credit.c) : Program that identifies the credit card issuer.

### pset2: Arrays
- [scrabble.c](/pset2/scrabble/scrabble.c) : Word-scoring game.
- [readability.c](/pset2/readability/readability.c) : Implementation of the Coleman-Liau index to gauge the understandability of a text.
- (2023) [bulbs.c](/pset2/bulbs/bulbs.c) : Encoding messages in binary using sequences of bulbs.
- [caesar.c](/pset2/caesar/caesar.c) : Implementation of the Caesar cipher algorithm.
- [substitution.c](/pset2/substitution/substitution.c) : Implementation of the substitution cipher.
- (2023) [wordle.c](/pset2/wordle/wordle.c) : Word-guessing game, similar to the famous [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

### pset3: Algorithms
- [sort](/pset3/sort) : Exercise to determine which sorting algorithm is being used.

- [tideman.c](/pset3/tideman/tideman.c) : Program that simulates a tideman vote election.

### pset4: Memory
- [volume.c](/pset4/volume/volume.c) : Program that increases/decreases the volume of a .wav audio file.
- [filter-less](/pset4/filter/filter-less) : Program that applies a filter on a BMP image file (grayscale, sepia, reflection or blur).
- [filter-more](/pset4/filter/filter-more) : Program that applies a filter on a BMP image file (grayscale, reflection, blur or edges).
- [recover.c](/pset4/recover/recover.c) : Recovering JPEGs from a memory card.

### pset5: Data Structures
- [inheritance.c](/pset5/inheritance/inheritance.c) : Program that creates a family of a specified generation size and assigns blood type alleles to each family member.

### practice-problems
These are additional problems after completing the problem set for a week. These exercises aren't warm-ups; in fact, they often pose a greater challenge than the problems in the main problem set.
- **pbm1**
  - (2023) [population.c](/practice-problems/pbm1/population/population.c) : Program that calculates the population growth time.
  - [debug.c](/practice-problems/pbm1/debug/debug.c) : For becoming familiar with C syntax and debugging programs
  - [half.c](/practice-problems/pbm1/half/half.c) : Program that calculates the restaurant bill and splits it for two people.
  - [prime.c](/practice-problems/pbm1/prime/prime.c) : Implementation of prime number counting.
- **pbm2**
  - [hours.c](/practice-problems/pbm2/hours/hours.c) : Program that calculates total or average hours attended.
  - [no-vowels.c](/practice-problems/pbm2/no-vowels/no-vowels.c) : Program that substitutes vowels in words, i.e., leetspeak.
  - [password.c](/practice-problems/pbm2/password/password.c) : Password quality verification.
- **pbm3**
  - [atoi.c](/practice-problems/pbm3/atoi/atoi.c) : Program that converts a string to an integer recursively.
  - [temps.c](/practice-problems/pbm3/temps/) : Program to practice *O*(n²) sorting algorithms.
  - [max.c](/practice-problems/pbm3/max/max.c) : A linear search algorithm to find the max value.
  - [snackbar.c](/practice-problems/pbm3/snackbar/snackbar.c) : Program that searches for items in the menu and calculates the total price.
- **pbm4**
  - [bottomup.c](/practice-problems/pbm4/bottomup/bottomup.c) : Program that copies and inverts a BMP image file
  - [license.c](/practice-problems/pbm4/license/license.c) : For practice working with files and file pointers.
