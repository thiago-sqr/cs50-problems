# CS50-problems
Solving the problem sets proposed by Harvard University's CS50x course (2024): Introduction to Computer Science.

## Repository Structure

### pset1: C
- [hello.c](/pset1/hello/hello.c) : Program that prints "hello" and your name.
- [mario](/pset1/mario) : Implementations (less and more complex) of the Mario pyramid.
- [cash.c](/pset1/cash/cash.c) : Program that calculates the number of coins for change.
- [credit.c](/pset1/credit/credit.c) : Program that identifies the credit card issuer.

### pset2: Arrays
- [scrabble.c](/pset2/scrabble/scrabble.c) : Word-scoring game.
- [readability.c](/pset2/readability/readability.c) : Implementation of the Coleman-Liau index to gauge the understandability of a text.
- (2023) [bulbs.c](/pset2/bulbs/bulbs.c) : Encoding messages in binary using sequences of bulbs.
- [caesar.c](/pset2/caesar/caesar.c) : Implementation of the Caesar cipher algorithm.
- [substitution.c](/pset2/substitution/substitution.c) : Implementation of the substitution cipher.
- (2023) [wordle.c](/pset2/wordle/wordle.c) : Word-guessing game, similar to the famous [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

### pset3: Algorithms
- [sort](/pset3/sort) : Exercise to determine which sorting algorithm is being used.
- [plurality.c](/pset3/plurality/plurality.c) : Program that simulates a plurality vote election.
- [runoff.c](/pset3/runoff/runoff.c) : Program that simulates a runoff vote election.
- [tideman.c](/pset3/tideman/tideman.c) : Program that simulates a tideman vote election.

### pset4: Memory
- [volume.c](/pset4/volume/volume.c) : Program that increases/decreases the volume of a .wav audio file.
- [filter-less](/pset4/filter/filter-less) : Program that applies a filter on a BMP image file (grayscale, sepia, reflection or blur).
- [filter-more](/pset4/filter/filter-more) : Program that applies a filter on a BMP image file (grayscale, reflection, blur or edges).
- [recover.c](/pset4/recover/recover.c) : Recovering JPEGs from a memory card.

### pset5: Data Structures
- [inheritance.c](/pset5/inheritance/inheritance.c) : Program that creates a family of a specified generation size and assigns blood type alleles to each family member.
- [speller](/pset5/speller/) : Program that spell-check a text file using a hash table.

### pset6: Python
- **sentimental**: Solving some problems from previous weeks in Python.
    - [hello.py](/pset6/sentimental/hello/hello.py) , [mario](/pset6/sentimental/mario) , [credit.py](/pset6/sentimental/credit/credit.py) , [readability.py](/pset6/sentimental/readability/readability.py)
- [dna.py](/pset6/dna/dna.py) : Program that identifies the owner of a DNA sequence using a database of the longest STR runs.

### pset7: SQL
- [songs](/pset7/songs) : Simple SQL queries to answer questions about a Spotify database.
- [movies](/pset7/movies) : SQL queries to answer questions about an IMDb database of movies.
- [fiftyville](/pset7/fiftyville) : Solving a theft mystery using SQL to query the database of Fiftyville Town.

### pset8: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- [trivia](/pset8/trivia) : Webpage with trivia questions.
- [homepage](/pset8/homepage) : Creating a homepage about my favorite pokemon.

### practice-problems
These are additional problems after completing the problem set for a week. These exercises aren't warm-ups; in fact, they often pose a greater challenge than the problems in the main problem set.
